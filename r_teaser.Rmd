## What is R?

> R is a programming language and software  environment for statistical computing, data  analysis and graphics

* Provides  wide variety of statistical and  graphical techniques, including linear and  nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests,  timeseries analysis, classification, clustering

* Allows for reproducible research & automation

## How to get started?

1. Install R from http://r-project.org

2. Install an editor like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

R Studio is an excellent FREE development environment for writing your own R code. It allows the user to run R in a more user-friendly environment.

## Packages

* R *just* ships with a small set of functions.

* R can be extened with _packages_, which are collections of user written R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format.

# How to install and use a new package?


###  Install it once

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

### Load it before you use it

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Example: Analysis of Mammalian Sleep Patterns


```{r setup, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

## adjust print rendering
options(
  width = 90,
  dplyr.width = 70,
  dplyr.print_max = 20
)
```

```r
# Load the libaries which we will need for the analysis
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


## Read data from tsv and assign it to a variable
msleep = read_tsv("data/msleep.tsv")

## Explore the data
head(msleep)
glimpse(msleep)

## Create a new column
msleep = mutate(msleep, rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total)

## Analyze correlation 
ggplot(msleep, 
    aes(sleep_total, rem_proportion, color=vore, size=brainwt)
) + geom_point(alpha=0.7)
```

---
## Read Data from File and Assign it to Variable

```{r, warning=F}
msleep = read_tsv("data/msleep.tsv")
```

---
## Explore the Data


```{r, warning=F}
head(msleep)
```

---
## Explore the data (cont.)


```{r, warning=F}
glimpse(msleep)
```

---
## Create a New Column


```{r, warning=F}
msleep = mutate(msleep, rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total)

glimpse(msleep)
```

---
## Analyze Correlation

```{r, warning=F,  fig.height=6}
ggplot(msleep, 
    aes(sleep_total, rem_proportion, color=vore, size=brainwt)
) + geom_point(alpha=0.7)
```

## Recap: Analysis of Mammalian Sleep Patterns

```r
# Load the libaries which we will need for the analysis
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


## Read data from tsv and assign it to a variable
msleep = read_tsv("data/msleep.tsv")

## Explore the data
head(msleep)
glimpse(msleep)

## Create a new column
msleep = mutate(msleep, rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total)

## Analyze correlation 
ggplot(msleep, 
    aes(sleep_total, rem_proportion, color=vore, size=brainwt)
) + geom_point(alpha=0.7)
```

## Data Manipulation with `dlyr`

> `dplyr` takes tables as input and creates new tables

It implements the following verbs useful for data manipulation:

* `select()` retains/removes a subset of variables
* `filter()` retains/removes a subset of rows
* `mutate()` derives new columns
* `arrange()` re-orders the rows in a table
* `summarise()` reduces data to a smaller number of summary statistics
* `group_by()` takes a table and converts it into a _grouped table_ where operations are performed by group

Fast, battle tested, very consistent (that is easy to learn and to recall).


```r
msleep %>% 
    filter(order=="Primates") %>%
    mutate(rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total) %>%
    select(name, rem_proportion) %>%
    filter(rem_proportion>0.3)
```

## Grammar of Graphics

<!-- https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/ -->
<div style="float:right; margin-left:50px; width:200px">

![](assets/graphics_grammar.jpg)

</div>

Decompose plots, into building blocks to create solid, creative, meaningful visualizations

* Leland Wilkinson, Grammar of Graphics, 1999
* 2 principles
  1. Graphics are composed of distinct layers of grammatical elements
  2. Data attributes mapped to aesthetics

* Formal description
```
plot ::= coord scale+ facet? layer+
layer ::= data mapping stat geom position?
```

---
## Build beautiful visualizations with `ggplot2`

1. one or more layers,
2. scales to map variables from data space to visual space (like colors)
3. a coordinate system
4. Statistical transformations
5. (optional) facetting to divide a plot into multiple panels

```{r fig.height=3}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=as.factor(cyl), y=mpg)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_point(position="jitter") +
    ggtitle("Relation of cylinders and fuel consumption") +
    xlab("# cylinders") + ylab("miles per gallon")
```

## R is Good Scientific Practice

Excel is not. :-(

R has a learning curve but not as steep as python

Pros
1. Interact with R in a **single, seamless stream**

2. **Iterate quickly** on code and output; see code and output together.

3. Leave a **clean, reproducible record** of your analysis in a simple text file.

4. Document your analysis with **rich, literate prose**

5. **Share the analysis** easily.

6. **One-click export** to HTML, PDF and Word
